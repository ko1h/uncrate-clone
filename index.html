          <h2>DESERTED IRISH ISLAND</h2>
          <p>Unoccupied for centuries with ruins thousands of years old, High Island is a unique chance to own a piece of history. It sits in the Atlantic Ocean off the western coast of Ireland, and is home to a monastery dating back to the 600s, with a floor that dates back to an Iron Age settlement circa 300 BC. Measuring 80 acres, it takes roughly an hour to walk from one end to the other, and the isle has multiple inlets that sit at the bottom of cliffs, with its 206-foot elevation providing some peace of mind amidst rising sea levels. While the ruins are owned and maintained by the Irish Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and thus aren't part of the sale, a septic tank installed for state use does improve the odds of getting building approval for a new dwelling.</p>

          <h2>GLCO X MALBON GOLF HAMPTON SUNGLASSES</h2>
          <p>A collaboration between two California brands, these GLCO x Malbon Golf Hampton Sunglasses are ideal for sunny days on the course. They're based on Garrett Leight's Hampton silhouette, with a round shape rendered here in a demi blonde color. The frames are paired with semi-flat pure green lenses that boost contrast on the greens and have a hidden logo that only becomes visible upon breathing on the lens. They arrive in a custom golf ball white case with an exclusive cleaning cloth and are part of a collection that also includes a reversible hat and leather head cover.</p>

          <h2>2019 BMW ALPINA B7 SEDAN</h2>
          <p>The line between supercar and sedan is beginning to get extremely blurry with Alpina's new B7 sedan, based on the new BMW 7-series. Taking the mantle of fastest production sedan in the world, the B7 improves on the 7-Series with a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 with 600 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. This is enough to push the B7 from 0-60 in just 3.5 seconds and to a top speed of 205 MPH — numbers which are in supercar territory. The increased power comes from improved turbocharger internals and tweaked engine management software. Alpina has also improved the driving aids, adding a Sport+ mode that adjusts the dampers and lowers the ride height by half an inch at the press of a button. The ultimate version of the 7-Series arrives later in 2019 in Alpina's signature blue and multi-spoke wheels.</p>

          <h2>STELLAVIE PRINTS</h2>
          <p>Hamburg-based Stellavie describes itself as both a graphic design studio and print shop. It's the union of those two disciplines that makes their prints so noteworthy. As seen in their Maps series of both the Northern and Southern skies, they have a knack for conveying information in an eye-pleasing way, while their Maze print straddles the line between functional puzzle and pure art. All their works are hand-printed on archival papers using quality inks, making them great additions to any space. </p>

          <h2>NEW BALANCE 997H SNEAKER</h2>
          <p>New Balance revises one of their most classic silhouettes with the 997H. The new model comes with updated features like a GCEVA construction and a light-weight outsole that give the sneaker an updated appearance. Subtle nods to the original 1991 design are found in the suede and mesh details as well as the four 90s-inspired colorways. Altogether, the result is a sleek, modernization that is equal parts innovative and nostalgic. </p>

          <h2>NOMOS NEOMATIK 41 UPDATE WATCH</h2>
          <p>Creative complications are nothing new for Nomos. Neither is the timeless, understated design that has become the signature of this German watchmaker. The latest addition to the Neomatik line is a brilliant example, powered by a new in-house automatic movement with a date ring placed around the perimeter. The ring is a refreshing take on an age-old complication, moved from the traditional dial space to the outermost edges between the bezel and hour markers. Two red markers move once every 24 hours to bracket the day's date — an innovative feature that helped this timepiece take home a prestigious GPHG design award. The case is made of stainless steel with a sapphire glass display back, and is available with a white silver-plated dial with galvanized black hands, or the darker dial refined with ruthenium with rhodium-plated hands. Each watch is finished with a strap crafted from Horween Genuine Shell Cordovan leather and a polished Nomos winged clasp.</p>
